## Taskmaster

A basic to-do list application built using Flutter and Google Firebase.

## Development Status

I'm putting this project temporarily on hold. I can see myself picking this back up in the future pretty soon, but am currently working on other projects. Plus, I would like to transition this to an iOS application, but currently lack the resources to do so.

However, if you'd like to pick this project up from where it currently stands, development is pretty modularized and straight forward. It includes button functionality, a decent user interface, and Firebase integration.
